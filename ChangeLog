This file tries to adhere to [Good Changelog Principles](https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog).

## [0.6.2]

### Added

* `--version` option to display version

### Changed

* "Parsing config file ..." message now omitted when not verbose or debug
* "Using SQLite database file ..." message now omitted when not verbose or
debug
* Default for `alignment-program` is now `mafft-linsi`
* Updated `calculate_statistics_orthograph_results.pl`:
  1. It now checks whether there are hits for each species of the analysis
  2. If not the values 0 are printed as output for all the statistics
  3. It also checks whether the aa output directory for each species exists

### Fixed

* Fixed version mismatch in testing dependencies

## [0.6.1]

### Fixed

* SWIPE executable is only tested if `reverse-search-algorithm` is set to
`swipe` and `swipe-program` is set

### Changed

* `fill-with-x` is now disabled by default and must be turned on if desired
* removed `no-fill-with-x` option.

## [0.6.0]

### Added

* SWIPE algorithm now supported. Additional options:
`reverse-search-algorithm` (values: 'blast' or 'swipe'; default: 'blast') and
`swipe-program` (default value: 'swipe')

### Changed

* Output directory for BLAST/SWIPE search results is now named 'reverse' by default
* Changed option name 'blastp-output-dir' to 'reverse-search-output-dir'

### Fixed

* `fill-with-x` is now negatable by using `no-fill-with-x`
* Statistics script now calculates correct N50
* Fix off-by-one-bug that made inserted X/NNN too long
* Table files with Windows or old Mac linebreaks no longer break ortholog set generation
* Whitespace in file names no longer breaks commands like `fastatranslate`
* Updated README because it was still talking about native OrthoDB tables w/o reformatting; also added info for newer OrthoDB versions

## [0.5.14]

### Added

* Added `--make-set` option to just generate the set (HMM files and BLAST database) and then quit

### Fixed

* Using `use lib $FindBin::RealBin` now to avoid issues with soft links
* Can now handle sequence headers with trailing whitespaces correctly (by removing them)

## [0.5.13]

### Fixed

* Fix bug in makeblastdb version check
* Fix bug in mafft version check

## [0.5.12]

### Added

* Added `--test-deps` option with description to man page

### Fixed

* Fixed dependency version check

## [0.5.11]

### Added

Added a test dataset using a subset of the Orussus abietinus transcriptome
from 1KITE (http://1kite.org). The dataset is configured in the default config
file so just starting Orthograph will verify a correct installation.

## [0.5.11]

### Added

Added a test dataset using a subset of the Orussus abietinus transcriptome
from 1KITE (http://1kite.org). The dataset is configured in the default config
file so just starting Orthograph will verify a correct installation.

### Changed

- Orthograph now reads ortholog set information from a simple, three-column
table. The columns must be tab-separated and be:
  - ortholog gene id
  - sequence id
  - taxon name
Generating such a table from OrthoDB tables is trivial using GNU tools such as
`cut`. The README was amended accordingly.

- Removed the option `--logfile`. It was rubbish anyway because the reporter
would overwrite the analyzer logfile unless you changed it, and analyzer and
reporter create separate, uniquely identifiable logfiles automatically in the
log dir.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug in the database backend modules that prevented identical taxon
names in the database.

## [0.5.10] - 2016-03-01

### Added

- Added `--test-deps` option to check whether dependencies have been properly
installed in sufficient versions. All dependencies, their required versions
and download URLs are listed in the README.

### Fixed

- In the database, BLAST results had reversed coordinates (end-start). This
had no influence on the results.

## [0.5.9] - 2016-02-04

### Added

- Added another tabular output file, non-overlapping-best-reciprocal-hits.txt,
that contains, well, non-overlapping sequence sections that fulfilled the BRH
criterion. They may, however, overlap on HMM level (paralogous copies
perhaps).

### Changed

- Renamed the other tabular output files:
	* homologous_transcripts.txt is now best-reciprocal-hits.txt
	* non_redundant_orthologous_transcripts.txt is now summary.txt

- Added e-value column to best-reciprocal-hits.txt table

## [0.5.8] - 2016-02-01

### Changed

- The helper script `summarize_orthograph_results.pl` can now mask internal
stop codons, clip terminal stop codons and mask selenocystein characters. The
new options are `-s`, `-t`, and `-u`, respectively.

- The helper script `make-ogs-corresponding.pl` can now run with multiple
threads using `--num-threads`. This requires the module
`Parallel::Forkmanager`.

- Changed change log to more sensible format

### Fixed

- orthograph2hamstrad.pl now also accepts directories that were summarized
using summarize_orthograph_results.pl

- Description is now really optional when uploading a new ortholog set

- Uses ali coordinates instead of env coordinates for everything


## [0.5.7] - 2015-11-24

### Changed

- Moved notification on reftaxon skipping to `verbose`, improved wording on
said message

- Alignment files for ortholog set now contain the reference OGS headers, not
just database IDs

### Fixed

- Fixed bug in orthograph2hamstrad.pl that prevented summarized data to be
converted

## [0.5.8] - 2016-02-01

## [0.5.6] - 2015-08-26

### Added

- Added `brh-only` option to restrict mappings to a single transcript per COG

- Added Makefile. Currently has only the target 'doc' to compile a PDF version
of the manual.

- Added `alignment.err` logfile to capture stderr during HMM generation, for
troubleshooting

### Changed

- Minor changes


## [0.5.5] - 2015-08-04

### Added

- Added option `exonerate-alignment-model`.

- Added length statistics script by Alex V.

### Changed

- Minor changes in example config

- Minor changes in error reporting

### Fixed

- Fixed bug in make-ogs-corresponding for cases where indels result in
multiple alignments for a single sequence pair

- Fixed COG table import for edge cases where you only have 6 columns


## [0.5.4] - 2015-06-17

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug in orthograph2hamstrad converter
