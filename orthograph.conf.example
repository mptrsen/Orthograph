# E-value threshold. The HMMsearch e-value threshold affects the specificity of
# the HMM search, the first step in the reciprocal algorithm. It defines how
# distantly related candidate orthologs may be when searching through the
# transcriptome file. The BLAST e-value threshold affects the second step, the
# reciprocal search. Basically, this defines the false-positive probability
# (lower e-value = lower probability).

# searches are required to effectively verify or reject a candidate ortholog,
# don't change this setting. 
# Defaults to 1000.

# The soft threshold is a special concept of Orthograph: While checking in
# strict mode (see below) whether the reciprocal hits are part of the ortholog
# group in question, this many mismatches may occur before the ortholog
# candidate is rejected.

# Selenocysteine (U) may occur in some protein sequences. However, some
